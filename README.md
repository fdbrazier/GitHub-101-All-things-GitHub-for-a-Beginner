# GitHub-101-All-things-GitHub-for-a-Beginner
Learning the basics of GitHub and applying what I learn as a novice.  
After signing up for my GitHub account, I decided to make my first repository about the basics of learning GitHub.  
My objectives for this assignment are as follows:
Create a Repository,
Create a Branch,
Make and Commit Changes,
and Open and Merge a Pull Request.

I initially signed up for a GitHub account using my email address and password.  I am including a screenshot below of me signing into my GitHub account.
